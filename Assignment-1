1. *- expression
   'hello'- value
   -87.8- value
   - - expression
   / -expression
   +- expression
   6- value

2. String : String can be written in quotes
   Example : "banana",'banana'

   Variable : It is the thing in which we can store data just like a container.

3. List : list is used for storing multiple data items in a single variable.
           
   Integer : integer can store only numerical values.

   Float: float can store only floating values
   Example : 322.22,22.2, etc.

4. Expression is made up of values, containers, and mathematical operators (operands)
   Example : 
           a = 2 + 3     and expressions are 
           used to evaluate the values or
           represent the result in the screen.

5. Expression is made up of values, containers, and mathematical operators (operands) and the statement is just like a command that a python interpreter executes like print.

6. 23 as execution code

7. Same

8. We can't start giving variable an integer name. if we, we should begin with, a string-like alphabet name then integer. e100 or eggs100 is valid

9. str(), int(), float()

10.because 99 is an integer it cannot be concatenated with strings, if we have to concatenate it we need to do typecasting.
